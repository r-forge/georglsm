<p class="quote">We are downing in information and starving for
knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;" class="quote">-Rutherford D. Roger<br>
</p>
<p>During the pursuit of advanced degrees in both physics and applied
statistics, I have
not only gained myself strong mathematical / statistical / data mining
background, but also the ability of independently solving problems with
logical thinking, intellectual curiosity, and exceptional programming
skills, through
numerous encounters with scientific and practical challenges.</p>
<p>As a research assistant in Biocomplexity institution at Indiana
University at Bloomington, I worked on cell potts model to study cell
energy exchange and the behavior of cellular structures during the
development of wing bud in chick embryo. It involved a lot of
time-based evolving simulations and Monte Carlo methods.</p>
<p>Later, as an analyst in statistical consulting center and research
assistant&nbsp; at University of Texas at San Antonio, I have worked on
different business problems as well as a variety of
research projects related to statistical modeling and diagnostics,
computing algorithms, design of experiments, and data mining, in the
fields of&nbsp; demographics, electronic engineering, marketing,
finance, etc. All these works enhanced my ability of quickly digesting
new knowledge
and flexibly reshaping existent methodologies to meet specific needs.<br>
</p>
<p>Plus, I
served as an independent instructor for college of Business, teaching
undergraduates <span style="font-style: italic;">Business Statistics</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Introduction to Statistics and
Data Analysis</span>.<br>
</p>
<p>Also, I am an enthusiast of programming and developing statistical
packages. I have independently developed a R package {<a
 href="../index.html">geoCount</a>} combined with C++
programs to
perform estimation, prediction and model checking for hierarchical
models with spatially-correlated data. I am completely comfortable with
large datasets and
Unix/Linux development environment, and also have sufficient experience
in using parallel computing techniques and working on high performance
computing cluster.<br>
</p>
<p>The future is full of mystery and uncertainties. Keep moving
forward, with the faith in the heart and the feet on the ground. "Life
is either a daring adventure or nothing"&nbsp; -Helen Keller.</p>
