Description: This package mainly deals with generalized linear spatial models.
 1)It performs posterior sampling for parameter estimation, prediction, 
 and model checking in hierarchical models with correlated latent variables; 
 2) C++ programs are seamlessly embedded to handle heavy computational 
 tasks of Markov chain generation and large matrices computation;
 3) Parallel computing techniques are implemented to further speed 
 up estimation and prediction; 
 4) results are displayed by a combination of numerical and graphical summaries.
