Description: This package provides a variety of functions to analyze and model geostatistical count data with generalized linear spatial models, including
 1) simulate and visualize the data;
 2) posterior sampling with robust MCMC algorithms (in serial or parallel way);
 3) perform prediction for unsampled locations;
 4) conduct Bayesian model checking procedure to evaluate the goodness of fitting;
 5) conduct transformed residual checking procedure.
 In the package, seamlessly embedded C++ programs and parallel computing techniques are implemented to speed up the computing processes.
